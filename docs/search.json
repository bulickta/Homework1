Generally speaking, the difference seems to be that statisticians tend to approach a problem from a more formal/theoretical standpoint, assigning confidence intervals and p-values as appropriate, and data scientists approach the problem more pragmatically/programmatically, identifying ways in which a set of inputs can generate a desired output, rather than necessarily considering a stochastic model.\n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\n\nMy background is definitely that of a statistician, as I have much more familiarity with the mathematical aspect of analyzing data than I do with the programming side, but I certainly see the value in gaining and implementing both skill sets to address a problem."
